# The RPC generator generates a communication protocol between a server and a client
# The server provides a header file that contains function declarations that are made available to the client via RPC calls
# Relative paths are relative to the config file
# There are 2 config files, one for the client and one for the server
# This is the server's config file that specifies which header to use and where to put the generated code
# This config file is intended to be parsed by Python's configparser, for syntax documentation refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
